This is a project about knowledge discovery from mobile data
Using innovative methods in order to cluster mobile phone users based on their location history.
The use of semantic location, rather than geographical location, makes it possible to identify similar users based on their lifestyle. 

Folders:

1. Clustering Methods: algorithm used to cluster the data

2. Internal_validity_indices: Dunn index and Connectivity measure implemented by me

3. Literature_methods: distance measures from literature review

4. My_methods: new distance measures I'm working with
